# Exoplanet Transit Simulator

This simulator visualizes exoplanet transits and the resulting photometric data. It shows how planets passing in front of their host star cause measurable dips in brightness.

## Features

- Simulates two exoplanets with different orbital parameters
- Visualizes transit events with light rays
- Generates real-time light curve
- Shows transit event timeline

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Running the Simulator

```bash
python exoplanet_transit_simulator.py
